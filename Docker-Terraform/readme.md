## Running Postgres in a container 

Create a folder anywhere you'd like for Postgres to store data in. We will use the example folder ny_taxi_postgres_data. Here's how to run the container:
```bash
docker run -it \
    -e POSTGRES_USER="root" \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="root" \
    -e POSTGRES_DB="ny_taxi" \
    -v $(pwd)/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
    -p 5432:5432 \
    postgres:13
```
* The container needs 3 environment variables:
    * `POSTGRES_USER` is the username for logging into the database. We chose `root`.
    * `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is the password for the database. We chose `root`
        * ***IMPORTANT: These values are only meant for testing. Please change them for any serious project.***
    * `POSTGRES_DB` is the name that we will give the database. We chose `ny_taxi`.
* `-v` points to the volume directory. The colon `:` separates the first part (path to the folder in the host computer) from the second part (path to the folder inside the container).
    * Path names must be absolute. If you're in a UNIX-like system, you can use `pwd` to print you local folder as a shortcut; this example should work with both `bash` and `zsh` shells, but `fish` will require you to remove the `$`.
    * This command will only work if you run it from a directory which contains the `ny_taxi_postgres_data` subdirectory you created above.
* The `-p` is for port mapping. We map the default Postgres port to the same port in the host.
* The last argument is the image name and tag. We run the official `postgres` image on its version `13`.

Once the container is running, we can log into our database with [pgcli](https://www.pgcli.com/) with the following command:
```bash
pgcli -h localhost -p 5432 -u root -d ny_taxi
```
* `-h` is the host. Since we're running locally we can use `localhost`.
* `-p` is the port.
* `-u` is the username.
* `-d` is the database name.
* The password is not provided; it will be requested after running the command.

## Ingesting data to Postgres using python

_([Video source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JM-ziJt0WI&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=4))_

We will now create a Jupyter Notebook [Project.ipynb ](https://github.com/cesarc780/Data_Eng_2024/blob/main/Docker-Terraform/Project.ipynb) file which we will use to read a the PArquet file, transfrom it and  export it to Postgres.

We will use data from the [NYC TLC Trip Record Data website](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). and we will take the data from January 2021 "Yellow Taxi Trip Records" Since the format is Parquet we require to transform it to csv in order to make the code work
